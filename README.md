# BERTQA

Welcome to the supporting repository for the "Improved relation span detection in question answering systems over extracted knowledge bases"[research project](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=wKaGP_8AAAAJ&citation_for_view=wKaGP_8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC "research project"). It is designed to be easily run in [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/ "Code Ocean") without any modifications. The repository contains three main components: data, code, and configuration files for the execution environment. Additionally, metadata and version control program requirements are also included.

To run the code on Code Ocean, simply refer to the [relevant capsule](https://codeocean.com/capsule/3306547/tree "relevant capsule") from the DOI provided in the main article. If you prefer to use this repository, you will need to create a Docker container using the environment file and then add the data and code to it. Once executed, the output results will be available in the result file. Please note that some time-consuming results have been commented out due to time limitations in Code Ocean. If you wish to reproduce those tables, be sure to uncomment those parts before running the code.
