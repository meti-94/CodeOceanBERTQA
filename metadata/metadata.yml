name: Improved Relation Span Detection in Question Answering Systems over Extracted
  Knowledge Bases Capsule
description: In recent years, AI studies have been focused on developing question
  answering systems to deal with automatic answering natural language questions. Knowledge
  based open domain question answering systems can generate accurate answers to questions
  posed by users in various fields. However, these systems need further development
  to scale the domain of answer retrieval systems and question interpretation. Deep
  learning methods are one of the current approaches in this research area. Existing
  knowledge-based question answering systems use either manually curated knowledge
  bases such as Freebase or knowledge bases automatically extracted from unstructured
  texts such as Reverb, or a combination of both. In the case of open domain question
  answering systems, limited access to knowledge bases reduces the expandability of
  the system. Systems that use only curated knowledge bases have high precision with
  limited coverage; while systems that use extracted knowledge bases have higher coverage
  with generally lower precision. To improve the precision of question answering over
  extracted knowledge bases, this paper presents a solution to enhance detection of
  the relation span in the question, corresponding to the triples of the extracted
  knowledge base. First, a dataset with 16,675 simple questions is introduced along
  with answers based on the Reverb triples. Then, a method based on a fine-tuned BERT
  model for relation span detection in the questions is proposed. The results showed
  an increase in the precision of the relation span detection, so that the precision
  reached 99.65%.
